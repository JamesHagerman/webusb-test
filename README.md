# WebUSB tests

This was created with create-react-app.

My goal with this project is to connect to embedded systems via the WebUSB protocol. I started work on this a
while back but decided to move over to using Electron for my last USB project for various reasons.

Now it's time for me to dig back into this and get it working correctly!
